# 1. Project Charter

## ACIK Project Management Framework

---

## Introduction

This document defines the **long-term project management framework of ACIK** (Italian-Kazakh Trade Association), aiming to unify internal teams and external partners around a structured process that ensures effectiveness, clarity, and sustainability in achieving the association's strategic goals.

## Charter Purpose

The Project Charter serves as the foundational document that:

- **Authorizes** the project management system across ACIK
- **Defines** the governance structure and decision-making authority
- **Establishes** the unified approach to project execution
- **Aligns** internal teams and external partners toward common objectives
- **Ensures** accountability and transparency in all activities

## Scope of the Project Management System

### In Scope

- Business development and matchmaking activities
- Consulting and advisory services
- Event organization and coordination
- Marketing and communication campaigns
- Logistics and hospitality services
- Stakeholder engagement and relationship management
- Financial planning and budget control
- Performance monitoring and evaluation

### Out of Scope

- Individual member company operations (unless directly related to ACIK projects)
- Activities not aligned with ACIK's strategic goals
- Projects without proper authorization from leadership

## Project Management Approach

ACIK adopts a **cyclical project management methodology**:

```
Planning → Execution → Monitoring → Evaluation → Planning (next cycle)
```

### Key Principles

1. **Stakeholder-Centric**: All activities serve the interests of members, partners, and beneficiaries
2. **Results-Oriented**: Focus on measurable outcomes and tangible impact
3. **Collaborative**: Foster teamwork between Italian and Kazakh teams
4. **Adaptive**: Respond to changing circumstances and feedback
5. **Transparent**: Maintain clear communication and reporting
6. **Sustainable**: Build long-term capacity and institutional knowledge

## Authority and Governance

### Decision-Making Hierarchy

1. **President**: Strategic direction and final approval authority
2. **Vice President**: Quality oversight and cross-border coordination
3. **CEO**: Operational management and resource allocation
4. **CFO**: Financial planning and budget approval
5. **Project Manager**: Task execution and day-to-day coordination

### Project Approval Process

All major projects must follow this approval pathway:

1. **Initiation**: Project Manager submits proposal to CEO
2. **Review**: CEO evaluates alignment with strategic goals and resource availability
3. **Financial Assessment**: CFO reviews budget and funding sources
4. **Approval**: Vice President and/or President approve the project
5. **Launch**: Project Manager receives authorization to proceed

## Success Criteria

The ACIK project management system will be considered successful when:

- ✓ All team members understand their roles and responsibilities
- ✓ Projects are completed on time and within budget
- ✓ Stakeholder satisfaction rates exceed 80%

- ✓ Knowledge and best practices are documented and shared

## Constraints and Assumptions
