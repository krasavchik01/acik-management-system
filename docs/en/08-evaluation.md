┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Without Evaluation        │     With Evaluation       │
├────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│  • Repeat same mistakes    │  • Learn from failures    │

│  • Unclear impact          │  • Demonstrate value      │
│  • Stakeholder disconnect  │  • Engage stakeholders    │
│  • Resource waste          │  • Optimize resources     │

## Lessons Learned Documentation

### Structure

2. **Context**: Circumstances and background
3. **What Worked / Didn't Work**: Analysis of outcomes
4. **Why**: Root cause analysis
5. **Lesson**: The specific learning
6. **Action**: What to do differently next time
7. **Owner**: Who is responsible for implementing this lesson

### Example Format

```
Lesson #27: Event Catering

What Happened: At the March forum, we ran out of food 30 minutes
into the reception.

Context: We estimated 80 attendees but 95 showed up. Catering
was ordered for 80 people with no buffer.

What Didn't Work: Our estimation process didn't account for
potential over-registration.

Why: We didn't build in a contingency for higher attendance,
and we didn't have a process to adjust catering orders based
on last-minute registrations.

Lesson: Always order catering for 110-120% of expected
attendance.

Action: Update event planning checklist to include:
- Order for 120% capacity
- Confirm final numbers 48 hours before event
- Have backup catering arrangement

Owner: Project Manager
Status: Implemented in April event planning
```

### Lessons Learned Database

Maintain a **centralized repository** of lessons learned:
- Organized by category (events, logistics, marketing, etc.)
- Searchable
- Reviewed during planning of new activities
- Updated after each evaluation
